Title: "Introduction to Image Processing in iOS"

1) First step to image processing - what's an Image?

  a) Explain how an uncompressed image in memory is simply an array of pixels [include diagram]
  b) Explain a "Pixel", in 32-bit RGBA format, but touch upon other formats (HSV, YUV, 16-bit RGBA,etc)
  c) Talk briefly about color spaces, and the merits of understanding HSV and RGB
  d) Touch upon JPEG/PNG as compression formats
  e) [Code snippet] Core Graphics code to read in an image and convert it to a buffer so you can see each pixel value
  f) [Downloadable project] The above code, that reads in a small image and logs the raw color values in a nice grid (use the same small image from the diagram in part A)

2) The five methods.

For each of these methods, implement the same filter in each method so the reader can see the differences (maybe the grainy filter, or a blur filter or something). For each method, include:

  a) a discussion of how the method works (use illustrations as appropriate)
  b) and include code snippets throughout (but not step-by-step instructions)
  c) Then at the end of each section, include a downloadable demo that shows that simple filter implemented in that method.

Method 1: setting each pixel on your own using a for loop (brute force) Go into detail here though, understanding this will allow you to "create your own effects" [discussion/code snippets/downloadable demo]
Method 2: Using CoreGraphics and the Quartz2D frameworks (slightly old but still important) [discussion/code snippets/downloadable demo]
Method 3: Using CoreImage framework (latest and greatest)  [discussion/code snippets/downloadable demo]
Method 4: GPUImage [discussion/code snippets/downloadable demo]
Method 4: OpenGL and shaders. [discussion/code snippets/downloadable demo]-ommited

3) Where to go from here?
